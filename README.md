#How Containers are Disrupting Devops
Containers are disrupting DevOps by providing ways to automate the delivery process in easily manageable segments. The DevOps pipeline is becoming a continuous delivery process, with continuous development, integration, and deployment.  We asked, “how are containers redefining how DevOps is handled and what vendors and products are leading the change?”


##Containers Make Environments Consistent
Containers provide a common set of building blocks that can be reused in any stage of development to recreate identical environments for development, testing, staging, or production.  Containers extend the idea of "write once, deploy anywhere" to an infrastructure abstraction that application developers can easily consume and operations professionals can predictably manage.

##Containers Make Tooling Consistent
Containers provide a disposable unit of logic and computation that can be used to perform a vital component of the DevOps delivery pipeline in a reusable way.  Now critical code quality, analysis, build, and test functions can be packaged as containers and consistently reused within developer workspaces, continuous integration systems, and release management tools. Code productivity and tooling vendors are now able to inject their solutions into every phase of the pipeline.
